# PyQt4-py2exe-SimpleGui
This is simple GUI to generate an executable or the setup file from .py/.pyw files using py2exe

This was originally written for the python 2 version.
To use it you need to have installed PyQt4, the pyuic4 utility and py2exe.
The GUI uses Tkinter, so it is necessary to have it available, too.

Some improvementes that would be good to add are:

* PyInstaller and CxFreeze support.
* More options in the generated setup file.
* Support for multiple file proyects, depending on the tool to generate the .exe file.

Important Note!:
Remember, I wrote this as a hobby because I like to program. And I'm a self-taught junior programmer.
Any help would be welcome.
